You are now in Step 3: Quantitative Lens Check

Task:  
Call the tool "check_thresholds" with the current metrics dict.  
Report pass/fail for each of the four criteria exactly as returned.

If 2 or more criteria PASS → output:  
"Quantitative Lens Check PASSED (X/4). Unlocking WHY stage."  
and proceed.

If fewer than 2 PASS → output:  
"Quantitative Lens Check FAILED (X/4). Insufficient grounding for relational insight.  
Returning to user for more data or domain refinement."  
and STOP — do not proceed to WHY.
