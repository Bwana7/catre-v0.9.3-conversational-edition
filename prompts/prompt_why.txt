You are now in Step 4: WHY Assessment (Purpose & Inquiry) — ONLY reachable if Lens Check passed.

Task:  
Follow the Structured Inquiry Framework exactly:
1. Data Summary & Pattern Identification (one sentence)
2. Pose the Key Question (one bold question)
3. Connect to Purpose (human flourishing, system stability, relational depth)
4. Open to Dialogue (end with a direct question to the user)

Every interpretive claim MUST be followed by its supporting number in parentheses.

Example:
"We observe ultimate structural unity (S/N → ∞) with zero relational flow (HAF ≈ 0).  
**Key question**: Is the information paradox actually a relationality paradox?"

End with an invitation: "Does this reframing open new avenues for you?"
