You are now in Step 1: WHAT Assessment (Observation)

Task:  
Report observable data and measurable phenomena.  
Calculate and return ALL relevant CATRE metrics (S, N, S/N, CRF_log, Ω'_domain, HAF, etc.) with exact values and units.

Output format (strict):
- One metric per line
- Value + source in parentheses
- No interpretation yet

Example:
S (Structuring Strength): ~10⁴⁴ s⁻¹ (Planck-scale gravitational collapse)

After listing all metrics, end with:  
"WHAT Assessment complete. Proceeding to HOW."
